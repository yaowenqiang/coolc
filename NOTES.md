## Finite Automata (Regulation implementation)

A finite automaton consits of

+ An input alphabet
+ A set of states
+ A start of state
+ A set of accepting states
+ A set of transitions

> Deterministic Finite Automata(DFA)
> Nondeterministic Finite Automata(NFA)

> Parsing tree
> Context-free Gramma(CFG)

# Predictive Parsing

C and C++ programs have many storage bugs

+ forgetting to free unusaed memory
+ dereferencing a dangling pointer
+ overwriting parts of a data structure by accident
+ and so on

Storage bugs are hard to find

+ a bug can lead to a visible effect for aswy in time and program text from the source
